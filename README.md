# Intro

This is a fork of the famous [MASShortcut library](https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut). I have converted it to a Swift Package so that it can be easily installed via Swift Package Manager (SPM). Most of the credit for this goes to [SDGGiesbrecht](https://forums.swift.org/u/SDGGiesbrecht).

With this library you can easily implement Global Keyboard Shortcuts in your macOS app.

# Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://blog.rampatra.com/how-to-add-global-key-shortcuts-to-your-swift-app-using-masshortcut).

# Limitation

Doesn't support localization. It can only support one language for now. This will change once SPM allows to package resource files from Objective-C projects.
